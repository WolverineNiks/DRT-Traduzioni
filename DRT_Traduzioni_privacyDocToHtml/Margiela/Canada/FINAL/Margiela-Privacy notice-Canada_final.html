                            <p>This is information that is not directly associated with identified users individuals, but which by its very nature could, through processing and association with data held by third parties, allow these users to be identified. This category of data includes the IP addresses or domain names of the computers used by users who connect to the Site, the addresses in URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) ​​notation of the requested resources, information regarding access, information regarding location , the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the response given by the server (successful, error, etc.), the information regarding the user’s visit including data clickstream of the URL, within and from the Site, the duration of the visit on some pages and the interaction on these pages and other parameters relating to the operating system and the user’s IT environment.</p>

                            <p>These data are collected through the use of “cookies”.
