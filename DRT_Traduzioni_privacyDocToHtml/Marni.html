                            <p>In case of anonymous browsing, however, we inform you that the computer systems and software procedures used to operate the Site acquire, during their normal operation, some data whose transmission is implicit in the use of Internet communication protocols.</p>

                            <p>This is information that is not directly associated with identified users, but which by its very nature could, through processing and association with data held by third parties, allow these users to be identified.</p>

                            <p>This category of data includes the IP addresses or domain names of the computers used by users who connect to the Site, the addresses in URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) â€‹â€‹notation of the requested resources, information regarding access, information regarding location , the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the response given by the server (successful, error, etc.), the information regarding the userâ€™s visit including data clickstream of the URL, within and from the Site, the duration of the visit on some pages and the interaction on these pages and other parameters relating to the operating system and the userâ€™s IT environment.</p>

                            <p>These data are collected through the use of â€œcookiesâ€.

                            <p>The data collected while browsing the Site will be processed to (i) manage the Site and resolve any operating problems, (ii) make sure that the content of the Site is presented in the most effective way for its devices, developing, testing and making improvements to the Site, (iii) as far as possible, to keep the Site safe and secure, (iv) to obtain anonymous statistical information on the use of the Site and to check its correct functioning, (v) identify anomalies and/or abuses in the use of the Site. The data could also be used to ascertain responsibility in case of possible computer crimes committed against the Site or third parties and may be presented to the Judicial Authority, if this makes an explicit request.</p>

                            <h2>5. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA</h2>

                            <p>Some Personal Data that we will indicate you from time to time during the registration are necessary for the completion of the purchase contract and for administrative and accounting purposes.</p>

                            <p>In the description of the purposes in paragraph 3, we specified when it is necessary to provide Personal Data. Where not expressly indicated as mandatory, therefore, the provision of Personal Data is optional and there will be no consequences if you do not provide them, if not the impossibility for the Data Controllers or Joint Controllers to act as described (for example, the impossibility to carry out marketing activities).</p>

                            <p>The provision of data for this purpose is mandatory because in the absence of data the Data Controller or the Joint Controller will not be in a position to comply with their legal obligations.</p>

                            <h4>b. Defense of rights during judicial, administrative or extra-judicial proceedings and in disputes arising in connection with the services offered</h4>

                            <h2>4. WHAT PROCESSING ACTIVITIES WE CARRY OUT IF YOUâ€™RE USING OUR SITE AND YOU NAVIGATE WITHOUT BEING LOGGED IN</h2>

                            <p>The Site is managed by Marni using a platform provided for by YNAP, which manages all the purchasing activities via the Site as a data controller (Please click here to see YNAP information notice). It is possible to browse the Site without having to actively communicate your Personal Data if you are not logged in. In this case, while browsing the Site, you will remain anonymous, unless you decide to provide your data to communicate with one of the Data Controllers or with the Joint Controllers for one of the purposes described in paragraph 3.</p>

                            <p>In case of anonymous browsing, however, we inform you that the computer systems and software procedures used to operate the Site acquire, during their normal operation, some data whose transmission is implicit in the use of Internet communication protocols.</p>

                            <p>This is information that is not directly associated with identified users, but which by its very nature could, through processing and association with data held by third parties, allow these users to be identified.</p>

                            <p>This category of data includes the IP addresses or domain names of the computers used by users who connect to the Site, the addresses in URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) â€‹â€‹notation of the requested resources, information regarding access, information regarding location , the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the response given by the server (successful, error, etc.), the information regarding the userâ€™s visit including data clickstream of the URL, within and from the Site, the duration of the visit on some pages and the interaction on these pages and other parameters relating to the operating system and the userâ€™s IT environment.</p>

                            <p>These data are collected through the use of â€œcookiesâ€. We specifically use browser cookies for various purposes, including cookies strictly necessary for the operation of the Site and the use of services through the appropriate features, and the cookies that are used for personalization, performance/analysis and promotional activities. Our Cookie Policy [https://www.marni.com/ytos/Plugins/AreaLocalizer/Redirectarea?area=Help&#38;controllerName=LegalArea&#38;actionName=CookiePolicy] contains more information regarding the use of cookies on the Site, as well as the options for accepting or rejecting them.</p>

                            <p>The data collected while browsing the Site will be processed to (i) manage the Site and resolve any operating problems, (ii) make sure that the content of the Site is presented in the most effective way for its devices, developing, testing and making improvements to the Site, (iii) as far as possible, to keep the Site safe and secure, (iv) to obtain anonymous statistical information on the use of the Site and to check its correct functioning, (v) identify anomalies and/or abuses in the use of the Site. The data could also be used to ascertain responsibility in case of possible computer crimes committed against the Site or third parties and may be presented to the Judicial Authority, if this makes an explicit request.</p>

                            <h2>5. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA</h2>

                            <p>Some Personal Data that we will indicate you from time to time during the registration or purchase process are necessary for the completion of the purchase contract and for administrative and accounting purposes.</p>

                            <p>In the description of the purposes in paragraph 3, we specified when it is necessary to provide Personal Data. Where not expressly indicated as mandatory, therefore, the provision of Personal Data is optional and there will be no consequences if you do not provide them, if not the impossibility for the Data Controllers or Joint Controllers to act as described (for example, the impossibility to carry out marketing activities).</p>

                            <h2>12. HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS</h2>

                            <h2>5. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA</h2>

                            <p>Some Personal Data that we will indicate you from time to time during the registration or purchase process are necessary for the completion of the purchase contract and for administrative and accounting purposes.</p>

                            <p>In the description of the purposes in paragraph 3, we specified when it is necessary to provide Personal Data. Where not expressly indicated as mandatory, therefore, the provision of Personal Data is optional and there will be no consequences if you do not provide them, unless it is impossible for the Data Controllers or Joint Controllers to act as described (for example, the impossibility to carry out marketing activities).</p>

                            <h2> 6. HOW AND HOW LONG WE WILL PROCESS PERSONAL DATA</h2>

                            <p>The Personal Data provided to and/or collected by the Data Controllers or the Joint Controllers are processed and stored with automated tools and, in some cases, may be processed and stored on a paper backing. In particular, the Personal Data processed for purposes of marketing and of marketing in line with your preferences will be entered and stored in the CRM systems that allow the processing of Personal Data for these purposes.</p>

                            <p>The Personal Data will be stored for the time necessary to achieve the purposes for which they were collected. In particular, the following rules will apply:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>data collected to enter into and perform purchase contracts on the Site or in shops, including payments: up to the conclusion of administrative and accounting obligations. The billing data will be kept for 10 years from the billing date;</li>
                                <li>data of the registered user for joining the loyalty program: the data will be kept as long as the account is active. Even after the termination of the account, we will retain the data if this will be necessary to comply with legal obligations, to protect our rights or to prevent fraud;</li>
                                <li>data related to data subjectsâ€™ requests: the data will be stored until the request is satisfied;</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>In any case, for technical reasons, the termination of the processing and the consequent cancellation or irreversible anonymization of the related Personal Data will be definitive within thirty days from the terms indicated above.</p>

                            <p>With particular reference to the judicial protection of our rights or in case of requests from the authority, the data processed will be stored for the time necessary to process the request or to protect the right.</p>

                            <h2>11. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS & HOW WE RESPOND TO â€œDO NOT TRACKâ€ SIGNALS</h2>

                            <p>If you are a California resident, you may have the right to request and receive certain information about a companyâ€™s disclosure of your Personal Data to third parties for their own direct marketing use, and your choices with respect to such disclosures. Because we do not share your Personal Data with third parties for their own direct marketing use unless you are first given the opportunity to opt in or out, we are exempt from this requirement. If you still wish to learn more about our compliance with this requirement, please contact us at the address listed in paragraph 1.</p>

                            <p>As of January 1, 2020, you may be entitled to the below rights:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>the right to know. </strong>You may request information about the categories and specific pieces of Personal Data we have collected about you over the last 12 months, as well as the categories of sources from which such information is collected, the purpose for collecting such information, and the sale or disclosure for business purposes of your Personal Data to third parties, and the categories of third parties with whom this information was shared. You may also request a copy of the Personal Data we have collected, and upon request, we will provide this information to you in electronic form; </li>
                                <li><strong>the right to opt-out of the sale of your Personal Data to third parties. </strong>We do not sell your Personal Data at this time, and we do not sell the Personal Data of children under 16 years old;    </li>

                                <li><strong>the right to not be discriminated against </strong>for exercising any of the rights mentioned above.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>You can exercise your rights by contacting us using the details set out in paragraph 1. Whenever feasible for verification, we will match the identifying information provided by you to the Personal Data already maintained by us. If, however, we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request additional information. You may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. Such authorized agent must be registered with the California Secretary of State and must have permission to submit requests on your behalf. We may deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf.</p>

                            <h2>12. HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS</h2>

                            <p> The â€œDo Not Trackâ€ (â€œDNTâ€) privacy preference is an option that may be made in some web browsers allowing you to opt-out of tracking by websites and online services. At this time, global standard DNT technology is not yet finalized and not all browsers support DNT. We therefore do not recognize DNT signals and do not respond to them.</p>

                            <h2>13. THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISING</h2>

                            <p>We may use advertisers, third-party ad platform, tracking technologies and other advertising companies to serve advertisements on the Site and to improve the performance of our advertising across the Internet. Please be advised that such advertising companies may gather Personal Data about your visit to our Site or other websites (such as through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies) to enable such advertising companies to market products or services to you, to monitor which ads have been served to your browser and which webpages you were viewing when such ads were delivered. You can also generally opt-out of receiving personalized ads from third-party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or who follow the Digital Advertising Allianceâ€™s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt-out pages on the NAI website https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1  here and DAA website here https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&#38;lang=EN.</p>

                            <h2>14. LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES</h2>

                            <p> Our Site contain links to other third party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third party websites.

                            <h2>15. SECURITY</h2>

                            <p>We have adopted commercially reasonable security measures to protect your Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure or access. We may use third-party products and services to secure or store your information. We encrypt credit card numbers from e-commerce transactions conducted on our Site.

If you have any reason to believe that your interactions with the Site are no longer secure, please notify us immediately at the addresses provided above.</p>

                            <p>Additionally, please do not forget that it is essential for the safety of your data that your device is equipped with tools such as constant antivirus updates and that your internet provider provides a connection ensuring a secure data transmission through firewalls, spam filters, and similar measures.</p>

                            <h2>16. CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY STATEMENT</h2>

                            <h2>17. DISPUTES, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CHOICE OF LAW</h2>

                            <p>By using the Site, you and we agree that, if there is any controversy, claim, action, or dispute arising out of or related to your use of the Site, or the breach, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of this Privacy Statement or any part of it (â€œDisputeâ€), both parties shall first try in good faith to settle such Dispute by providing written notice to the other party describing the facts and circumstances of the Dispute and allowing the receiving party 30 days in which to respond to or settle the Dispute.</p>

                            <p>Notice shall be sent:</p>

                            <p>(1) to us at the address(es) listed above, towards the beginning of this Privacy Statement; and (2) to you at: the contact information on file with us. Both you and we agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent that must be satisfied before initiating any litigation or filing any claim against the other party.</p>

                            <p>IF ANY DISPUTE CANNOT BE RESOLVED BY THE ABOVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE, YOU AGREE THAT THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION FOR SUCH DISPUTE WILL BE DECIDED BY BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS MEANS THAT YOU WILL NOT HAVE, AND YOU WAIVE, THE RIGHT FOR A JUDGE OR JURY TO DECIDE YOUR CLAIMS, AND THAT YOU MAY NOT PROCEED IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. Other rights that you and we would have in court will not be available or will be more limited in arbitration, including discovery and appeal rights. All such Disputes shall be exclusively submitted to JAMS (www.jamsadr.com) for binding arbitration under its rules then in effect, before one arbitrator to be mutually agreed upon by both parties. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Privacy Statement, including any claim that all or any part of this Privacy Statement is void or voidable. This Privacy Statement has been made in, and shall be construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any conflict of law principles. The parties acknowledge that this Privacy Statement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Privacy Statement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1-16).</p>

                            <h2>18. ASSIGNMENT</h2>

Your information may be shared following completion of such transaction and/or during the assessment process pending transfer. If transferred in such a case, your information would remain subject to this Privacy Statement or a privacy policy that, at a minimum, protects your privacy to an equal degree as this Privacy Statement.</p>

                            <p>If you are a California resident, you may have the right to request and receive certain information about a companyâ€™s disclosure of your Personal Data to third parties for their own direct marketing use, and your choices with respect to such disclosures. Because we do not share your Personal Data with third parties for their own direct marketing use unless you are first given the opportunity to opt in or out, we are exempt from this requirement. If you still wish to learn more about our compliance with this requirement, please contact us at the address listed in paragraph 1.</p>

                            <p>As of January 1, 2020, you may be entitled to the below rights:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>the right to know. </strong>You may request information about the categories and specific pieces of Personal Data we have collected about you over the last 12 months, as well as the categories of sources from which such information is collected, the purpose for collecting such information, and the sale or disclosure for business purposes of your Personal Data to third parties, and the categories of third parties with whom this information was shared. You may also request a copy of the Personal Data we have collected, and upon request, we will provide this information to you in electronic form; </li>
                                <li><strong>the right to opt-out of the sale of your Personal Data to third parties. </strong>We do not sell your Personal Data at this time, and we do not sell the Personal Data of children under 16 years old;    </li>

Such authorized agent must be registered with the California Secretary of State and must have permission to submit requests on your behalf. We may deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf.</p>

                            <h2>12. HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS</h2>

                            <p> The â€œDo Not Trackâ€ (â€œDNTâ€) privacy preference is an option that may be made in some web browsers allowing you to opt-out of tracking by websites and online services. At this time, global standard DNT technology is not yet finalized and not all browsers support DNT. We therefore do not recognize DNT signals and do not respond to them.</p>

                            <h2>13. THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISING</h2>

                            <p>We may use advertisers, third-party ad platform, tracking technologies and other advertising companies to serve advertisements on the Site and to improve the performance of our advertising across the Internet.

                            <p>By using the Site, you and we agree that, if there is any controversy, claim, action, or dispute arising out of or related to your use of the Site, or the breach, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of this Privacy Statement or any part of it (â€œDisputeâ€), both parties shall first try in good faith to settle such Dispute by providing written notice to the other party describing the facts and circumstances of the Dispute and allowing the receiving party 30 days in which to respond to or settle the Dispute.</p>
