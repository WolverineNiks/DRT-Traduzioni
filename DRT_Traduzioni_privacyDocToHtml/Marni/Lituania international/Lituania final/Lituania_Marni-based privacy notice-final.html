                            <h2>4. WHAT PROCESSING ACTIVITIES WE CARRY OUT WHEN YOU’RE USING OUR SITE AND YOU NAVIGATE WITHOUT BEING LOGGED IN</h2>

                            <p>The Site is managed by Marni using a platform provided for by YNAP, which manages all the purchasing activities as a data controller (Please click here to see YNAP information notice). It is possible to browse the Site without having to actively communicate your Personal Data if you are not logged in. In this case, while browsing the Site, you will remain anonymous, unless you decide to provide your data to communicate with one of the Data Controllers or with the Joint Controllers for one of the purposes described in paragraph 3.</p>

                            <p>In case of anonymous browsing, however, we inform you that the computer systems and software procedures used to operate the Site acquire, during their normal operation, some data whose transmission is implicit in the use of Internet communication protocols.</p>

                            <p>This is information that is not directly associated with identified users, but which by its very nature could, through processing and association with data held by third parties, allow these users to be identified.</p>

                            <p>This category of data includes the IP addresses or domain names of the computers used by users who connect to the Site, the addresses in URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) ​​notation of the requested resources, information regarding access, information regarding location , the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the response given by the server (successful, error, etc.), the information regarding the user’s visit including data clickstream of the URL, within and from the Site, the duration of the visit on some pages and the interaction on these pages and other parameters relating to the operating system and the user’s IT environment.</p>

                            <p>These data are collected through the use of “cookies”. We specifically use browser cookies for various purposes, including cookies strictly necessary for the operation of the Site and the use of services through the appropriate features, and the cookies that are used for personalization, performance/analysis and promotional activities. Our Cookie Policy [https://www.marni.com/ytos/Plugins/AreaLocalizer/Redirectarea?area=Help&#38;controllerName=LegalArea&#38;actionName=CookiePolicy] contains more information regarding the use of cookies on the Site, as well as the options for accepting or rejecting them.</p>

                            <p>The data collected while browsing the Site will be processed to (i) manage the Site and resolve any operating problems, (ii) make sure that the content of the Site is presented in the most effective way for its devices, developing, testing and making improvements to the Site, (iii) as far as possible, to keep the Site safe and secure, (iv) to obtain anonymous statistical information on the use of the Site and to check its correct functioning, (v) identify anomalies and/or abuses in the use of the Site. The data could also be used to ascertain responsibility in case of possible computer crimes committed against the Site or third parties and may be presented to the Judicial Authority, if this makes an explicit request.</p>

                            <h2>5. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA</h2>

                            <p>Some Personal Data that we will indicate you from time to time during the registration are necessary for the completion of the purchase contract and for administrative and accounting purposes.</p>

                            <p>In the description of the purposes in paragraph 3, we specified when it is necessary to provide Personal Data. Where not expressly indicated as mandatory, therefore, the provision of Personal Data is optional and there will be no consequences if you do not provide them, if not the impossibility for the Data Controllers or Joint Controllers to act as described (for example, the impossibility to carry out marketing activities).</p>
