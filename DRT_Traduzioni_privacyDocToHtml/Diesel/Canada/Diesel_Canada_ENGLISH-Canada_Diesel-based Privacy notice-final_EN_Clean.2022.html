                            <p>Finally, each Data Controller or Join Controller may need to comply with a specific legal provision to which it is subject or to defend its own right in court.</p>

                            <h4>a. Purposes related to the obligations established by laws or regulations, by decisions/requests of competent authorities or by supervisory and control bodies</h4>

                            <p>Each Data Controller or Joint Data Controller may process your Personal Data to comply with a legal obligation to which it is subject.</p>

                            <p>Legal basis: compliance with a legal obligation.</p>

                            <p>The provision of data for this purpose is mandatory because in the absence of data the Data Controller or the Joint Data Controller will not be in a position to comply with their legal obligations.</p>

                            <h4>b. Defense of rights during judicial, administrative or extra-judicial proceedings and in disputes arising in connection with the services offered</h4>

                            <p>Legal basis: this processing is based on the legitimate interest pursued by the Data Controller or Joint Controller to protect their rights.</p>
