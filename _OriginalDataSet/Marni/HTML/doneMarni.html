                            <p>The Site is managed by Marni using a platform provided for by YNAP, which manages all the purchasing activities as a data controller (Please click here to see YNAP information notice).

In this case, while browsing the Site, you will remain anonymous, unless you decide to provide your data to communicate with one of the Data Controllers or with the Joint Controllers for one of the purposes described in paragraph 3.</p>

                            <p>In case of anonymous browsing, however, we inform you that the computer systems and software procedures used to operate the Site acquire, during their normal operation, some data whose transmission is implicit in the use of Internet communication protocols.</p>

                            <p>This is information that is not directly associated with identified users, but which by its very nature could, through processing and association with data held by third parties, allow these users to be identified.</p>

                            <p>This category of data includes the IP addresses or domain names of the computers used by users who connect to the Site, the addresses in URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) ​​notation of the requested resources, information regarding access, information regarding location , the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the response given by the server (successful, error, etc.), the information regarding the user's visit including data clickstream of the URL, within and from the Site, the duration of the visit on some pages and the interaction on these pages and other parameters relating to the operating system and the user's IT environment.</p>

                            <p>These data are collected through the use of "cookies". We specifically use browser cookies for various purposes, including cookies strictly necessary for the operation of the Site and the use of services through the appropriate features, and the cookies that are used for personalization, performance/analysis and promotional activities.

                            <p>The data collected while browsing the Site will be processed to (i) manage the Site and resolve any operating problems, (ii) make sure that the content of the Site is presented in the most effective way for its devices, developing, testing and making improvements to the Site, (iii) as far as possible, to keep the Site safe and secure, (iv) to obtain anonymous statistical information on the use of the Site and to check its correct functioning, (v) identify anomalies and/or abuses in the use of the Site. The data could also be used to ascertain responsibility in case of possible computer crimes committed against the Site or third parties and may be presented to the Judicial Authority, if this makes an explicit request.</p>

                            <h2>5. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA</h2>

                            <p>In the description of the purposes in paragraph 3, we specified when it is necessary to provide Personal Data. Where not expressly indicated as mandatory, therefore, the provision of Personal Data is optional and there will be no consequences if you do not provide them, if not the impossibility for the Data Controllers or Joint Controllers to act as described (for example, the impossibility to carry out marketing activities).</p>

                            <p>In the description of the purposes in paragraph 3, we specified when it is necessary to provide Personal Data. Where not expressly indicated as mandatory, therefore, the provision of Personal Data is optional and there will be no consequences if you do not provide them, if not the impossibility for the Data Controllers or Joint Controllers to act as described (for example, the impossibility to carry out marketing activities).</p>

                            <h2>11. HOW WE RESPOND TO "DO NOT TRACK" SIGNALS</h2>

                            <p>The "Do Not Track" ("DNT") privacy preference is an option that may be made in some web browsers allowing you to opt-out of tracking by websites and online services. At this time, global standard DNT technology is not yet finalized and not all browsers support DNT. We therefore do not recognize DNT signals and do not respond to them.</p>

                            <h2>12. THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISING</h2>

                            <p>We may use advertisers, third-party ad platforms, tracking technologies and other advertising companies to serve advertisements on the Site and to improve the performance of our advertising across the Internet. Please be advised that such advertising companies may gather Personal Data about your visit to our Site or other websites (such as through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies) to enable such advertising companies to market products or services to you, to monitor which ads have been served to your browser and which webpages you were viewing when such ads were delivered.

                            <p>Please note that even if you opt-out of interest-based advertising by a third party, these tracking technologies may still collect data for other purposes including analytics and you will still see ads from us, but the ads will not be targeted based on behavioural information about you and may therefore be less relevant to you and your interests.</p>

                            <p>To successfully opt-out, you must have cookies enabled in your web browser. Please see your browser's instructions for information on cookies and how to enable them.

Once you opt-out, if you delete your browser's saved cookies, you may need to opt-out again.</p>

                            <p>Marni et OTB opèrent en tant que responsables conjoints du traitement sur la base d'un accord spécifique pour la finalité indiquée ci-dessous.</p>

                            <h4>a. Profilage client</h4>

                            <p>Avec votre consentement, les Responsables conjoints du traitement auront le droit de traiter les Données biographiques, les Coordonnées, les Données d'achat, les Données de suivi des bulletins d'information, les Données d'actions et les Données de navigation à des fins de profilage et pour l'analyse commerciale, c'est-à-dire pour l'analyse de vos préférences d'achat consistant en un traitement automatisé des Données à caractère personnel susmentionnées.

                            <p>La fourniture des données à cette fin est obligatoire car, en l'absence de ces données, le Responsable du traitement ou le Responsable conjoint du traitement ne sera pas en mesure de se conformer à ses obligations légales.</p>

Il est possible de naviguer sur le Site sans avoir à communiquer activement vos Données à caractère personnel si vous n'avez pas ouvert de session. Dans ce cas, pendant que vous naviguez sur le Site, vous resterez anonyme, à moins que vous ne décidiez de fournir vos données pour communiquer avec l'un des Responsables du traitement ou avec les Responsables conjoints du traitement pour l'une des finalités décrites dans le paragraphe 3.</p>

                            <p>En cas de navigation anonyme, nous vous informons cependant que les systèmes informatiques et les procédures logicielles utilisées pour faire fonctionner le Site acquièrent, au cours de leur fonctionnement normal, certaines données dont la transmission est implicite lors de l'utilisation des protocoles de communication Internet.</p>

                            <p>Ces informations ne sont pas directement associées aux utilisateurs individuels identifiés, mais, par leur nature même, pourraient, par l'intermédiaire du traitement et de l'association avec des données détenues par des tiers, permettre d'identifier ces utilisateurs. Cette catégorie de données comprend les adresses IP ou les noms de domaine des ordinateurs utilisés par les utilisateurs qui se connectent au Site, les adresses en notation URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) des ressources demandées, les informations concernant l'accès et l'emplacement, le moyen utilisé pour envoyer la demande au serveur, la taille du fichier obtenu en réponse, le code numérique indiquant l'état de la réponse donnée par le serveur (succès, erreur, etc.), les informations concernant la visite de l'utilisateur, y compris les données de flux de clics de l'URL, à l'intérieur et à partir du Site, la durée de la visite sur certaines pages et l'interaction sur ces pages ainsi que d'autres paramètres en lien avec le système d'exploitation et l'environnement informatique de l'utilisateur.</p>

                            <h2>5. QUE SE PASSE-T-IL SI VOUS NE FOURNISSEZ PAS VOS DONNÉES À CARACTÈRE PERSONNEL ?</h2>

                            <p>Certaines Données à caractère personnel que nous vous indiquerons périodiquement au cours de l'inscription ou du processus d'achat sont nécessaires pour pouvoir exécuter le contrat d'achat et à des fins administratives et comptables.</p>

                            <p>Dans la description des finalités indiquées dans le paragraphe 3, nous précisons quand il est nécessaire de fournir les Données à caractère personnel. Si cela n'est pas expressément indiqué comme obligatoire, alors, la fourniture des Données à caractère personnel est optionnelle et cela n'entraînera aucune conséquence si vous ne les fournissez pas, si ce n'est l'impossibilité pour les Responsables du traitement ou les Responsables conjoints du traitement d'agir comme cela a été décrit (par exemple, l'impossibilité d'effectuer des activités de marketing).</p>

                            <h2> 6. COMMENT ET PENDANT COMBIEN DE TEMPS TRAITERONS-NOUS VOS DONNÉES À CARACTÈRE PERSONNEL ?</h2>

                            </ul>
                            <p>Dans tous les cas, pour des raisons techniques, la fin du traitement et la suppression qui s'ensuivra ou l'anonymisation irréversible des Données à caractère personnel concernées seront définitives dans les trente jours à compter des délais indiqués ci-dessus.</p>

                            <p>Avec une mention particulière en ce qui concerne la protection juridique de nos droits ou en cas de demandes provenant de l'Autorité, les données traitées seront conservées pour toute la durée nécessaire au traitement de la demande ou à la protection du droit.</p>

                            <h2>11. COMMENT RÉPONDONS-NOUS AUX SIGNAUX « DO NOT TRACK » ?</h2>

                            <p>La préférence de confidentialité « Do Not Track » (« DNT ») est une option qui peut être faite sur certains navigateurs web qui vous permet d'interdire le suivi par les sites web et les services en ligne. À l'heure actuelle, la référence technologique mondiale DNT n'est pas encore finalisée et certains navigateurs ne supportent pas l'option DNT. Par conséquent, nous ne reconnaissons pas les signaux DNT et nous n'y répondons pas.</p>

                            <h2>12. PUBLICITÉ FAITE PAR DES TIERS</h2>

Toutefois, les annonces ne seront pas ciblées sur les informations comportementales vous concernant et pourraient donc être moins pertinentes pour vous et pour vos intérêts.</p>

                            <p>In case of anonymous browsing, however, we inform you that the computer systems and software procedures used to operate the Site acquire, during their normal operation, some data whose transmission is implicit in the use of Internet communication protocols.</p>

                            <p>This is information that is not directly associated with identified users, but which by its very nature could, through processing and association with data held by third parties, allow these users to be identified.</p>

                            <p>This category of data includes the IP addresses or domain names of the computers used by users who connect to the Site, the addresses in URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) ​​notation of the requested resources, information regarding access, information regarding location , the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the response given by the server (successful, error, etc.), the information regarding the user's visit including data clickstream of the URL, within and from the Site, the duration of the visit on some pages and the interaction on these pages and other parameters relating to the operating system and the user's IT environment.</p>

The data could also be used to ascertain responsibility in case of possible computer crimes committed against the Site or third parties and may be presented to the Judicial Authority, if this makes an explicit request.</p>

                            <h2>5. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA</h2>

                            <h2>4. WHAT PROCESSING ACTIVITIES WE CARRY OUT WHEN YOU'RE USING OUR SITE AND YOU NAVIGATE WITHOUT BEING LOGGED IN</h2>

                            <p>The Site is managed by Marni using a platform provided for by YNAP, which manages all the purchasing activities as a data controller (Please click here to see YNAP information notice). It is possible to browse the Site without having to actively communicate your Personal Data if you are not logged in. In this case, while browsing the Site, you will remain anonymous, unless you decide to provide your data to communicate with one of the Data Controllers or with the Joint Controllers for one of the purposes described in paragraph 3.</p>

                            <p>In case of anonymous browsing, however, we inform you that the computer systems and software procedures used to operate the Site acquire, during their normal operation, some data whose transmission is implicit in the use of Internet communication protocols.</p>

                            <p>This is information that is not directly associated with identified users, but which by its very nature could, through processing and association with data held by third parties, allow these users to be identified.</p>

                            <p>This category of data includes the IP addresses or domain names of the computers used by users who connect to the Site, the addresses in URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) ​​notation of the requested resources, information regarding access, information regarding location , the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the response given by the server (successful, error, etc.), the information regarding the user's visit including data clickstream of the URL, within and from the Site, the duration of the visit on some pages and the interaction on these pages and other parameters relating to the operating system and the user's IT environment.</p>

                            <p>These data are collected through the use of "cookies". We specifically use browser cookies for various purposes, including cookies strictly necessary for the operation of the Site and the use of services through the appropriate features, and the cookies that are used for personalization, performance/analysis and promotional activities. Our Cookie Policy [https://www.marni.com/ytos/Plugins/AreaLocalizer/Redirectarea?area=Help&#38;controllerName=LegalArea&#38;actionName=CookiePolicy] contains more information regarding the use of cookies on the Site, as well as the options for accepting or rejecting them.</p>

                            <p>The data collected while browsing the Site will be processed to (i) manage the Site and resolve any operating problems, (ii) make sure that the content of the Site is presented in the most effective way for its devices, developing, testing and making improvements to the Site, (iii) as far as possible, to keep the Site safe and secure, (iv) to obtain anonymous statistical information on the use of the Site and to check its correct functioning, (v) identify anomalies and/or abuses in the use of the Site. The data could also be used to ascertain responsibility in case of possible computer crimes committed against the Site or third parties and may be presented to the Judicial Authority, if this makes an explicit request.</p>

                            <h2>5. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA</h2>

                            <p>Some Personal Data that we will indicate you from time to time during the registration are necessary for the completion of the purchase contract and for administrative and accounting purposes.</p>

                            <p>In the description of the purposes in paragraph 3, we specified when it is necessary to provide Personal Data. Where not expressly indicated as mandatory, therefore, the provision of Personal Data is optional and there will be no consequences if you do not provide them, if not the impossibility for the Data Controllers or Joint Controllers to act as described (for example, the impossibility to carry out marketing activities).</p>

                            <h3>3.4 PURPOSES OF ALL DATA CONTROLLERS OR JOINT CONTROLLERS</h3>

                            <p>Finally, each Data Controller or Join Controller may need to comply with a specific legal provision to which it is subject or to defend its own right in court.</p>

                            <h4>a. Purposes related to the obligations established by laws or regulations, by decisions/requests of competent authorities or by supervisory and control bodies</h4>

                            <p>Each Data Controller or Joint Controller may process your Personal Data to comply with a legal obligation to which it is subject.</p>

                            <p>Legal basis: compliance with a legal obligation.</p>

                            <p>The provision of data for this purpose is mandatory because in the absence of data the Data Controller or the Joint Controller will not be in a position to comply with their legal obligations.</p>

                            <h4>b. Defense of rights during judicial, administrative or extra-judicial proceedings and in disputes arising in connection with the services offered</h4>

                            <p>Your Personal Data may be processed by each Data Controller or Joint Controller to defend their rights or take legal action or make claims against you or third parties, including the prevention of fraud.</p>

                            <p>Legal basis: this processing is based on the legitimate interest pursued by the Data Controller or Joint Controller to protect their rights.</p>

                            <h2>4. WHAT PROCESSING ACTIVITIES WE CARRY OUT IF YOU'RE USING OUR SITE AND YOU NAVIGATE WITHOUT BEING LOGGED IN</h2>

                            <p>The Site is managed by Marni using a platform provided for by YNAP, which manages all the purchasing activities via the Site as a data controller (Please click here to see YNAP information notice). It is possible to browse the Site without having to actively communicate your Personal Data if you are not logged in. In this case, while browsing the Site, you will remain anonymous, unless you decide to provide your data to communicate with one of the Data Controllers or with the Joint Controllers for one of the purposes described in paragraph 3.</p>

                            <p>In case of anonymous browsing, however, we inform you that the computer systems and software procedures used to operate the Site acquire, during their normal operation, some data whose transmission is implicit in the use of Internet communication protocols.</p>

                            <p>This is information that is not directly associated with identified users, but which by its very nature could, through processing and association with data held by third parties, allow these users to be identified.</p>

                            <p>This category of data includes the IP addresses or domain names of the computers used by users who connect to the Site, the addresses in URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) ​​notation of the requested resources, information regarding access, information regarding location , the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the response given by the server (successful, error, etc.), the information regarding the user's visit including data clickstream of the URL, within and from the Site, the duration of the visit on some pages and the interaction on these pages and other parameters relating to the operating system and the user's IT environment.</p>

                            <p>These data are collected through the use of "cookies". We specifically use browser cookies for various purposes, including cookies strictly necessary for the operation of the Site and the use of services through the appropriate features, and the cookies that are used for personalization, performance/analysis and promotional activities. Our Cookie Policy [https://www.marni.com/ytos/Plugins/AreaLocalizer/Redirectarea?area=Help&#38;controllerName=LegalArea&#38;actionName=CookiePolicy] contains more information regarding the use of cookies on the Site, as well as the options for accepting or rejecting them.</p>

                            <p>The data collected while browsing the Site will be processed to (i) manage the Site and resolve any operating problems, (ii) make sure that the content of the Site is presented in the most effective way for its devices, developing, testing and making improvements to the Site, (iii) as far as possible, to keep the Site safe and secure, (iv) to obtain anonymous statistical information on the use of the Site and to check its correct functioning, (v) identify anomalies and/or abuses in the use of the Site. The data could also be used to ascertain responsibility in case of possible computer crimes committed against the Site or third parties and may be presented to the Judicial Authority, if this makes an explicit request.</p>

                            <h2>5. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA</h2>

                            <p>Some Personal Data that we will indicate you from time to time during the registration or purchase process in shops are necessary for the completion of the purchase contract and for administrative and accounting purposes.</p>

                            <p>In the description of the purposes in paragraph 3, we specified when it is necessary to provide Personal Data. Where not expressly indicated as mandatory, therefore, the provision of Personal Data is optional and there will be no consequences if you do not provide them, if not the impossibility for the Data Controllers or Joint Controllers to act as described (for example, the impossibility to carry out marketing activities).</p>

Vous avez le droit de vous opposer au marketing direct, ce qui inclut le profilage. Si vous préférez que le traitement de vos Données à caractère personnel ne soit effectué que par l'intermédiaire des moyens de communication traditionnels, vous pouvez vous opposer au traitement de vos données à caractère personnel effectué par l'intermédiaire de moyens de communication automatisés.</p>

                            <p>Vous avez également le droit de retirer, en totalité ou en partie, le consentement au traitement des Données à caractère personnel vous concernant à des fins d'envoi de matériel publicitaire ou de vente directe ou pour réaliser des études de marché ou des communications commerciales par l'intermédiaire de moyens de communication automatisés (courriel, autres systèmes de communication à distance par des réseaux de communication tels que, par exemple : SMS, MMS, plateformes de messagerie, etc.) et de moyens de communication traditionnels (courrier).</p>

                            <p>L'exercice de ces droits, qui peut avoir lieu par l'intermédiaire des coordonnées indiquées dans le paragraphe 1, n'est pas soumis à des contraintes formelles.

                            <p>The Site is managed by Marni using a platform provided for by YNAP, which manages all the purchasing activities via Site as a data controller (Please click here to see YNAP information notice). It is possible to browse the Site without having to actively communicate your Personal Data if you are not logged in. In this case, while browsing the Site, you will remain anonymous, unless you decide to provide your data to communicate with one of the Data Controllers or with the Joint Controllers for one of the purposes described in paragraph 3.</p>

                            <p>In case of anonymous browsing, however, we inform you that the computer systems and software procedures used to operate the Site acquire, during their normal operation, some data whose transmission is implicit in the use of Internet communication protocols.</p>

                            <p>This is information that is not directly associated with identified users, but which by its very nature could, through processing and association with data held by third parties, allow these users to be identified.</p>

                            <p>This category of data includes the IP addresses or domain names of the computers used by users who connect to the Site, the addresses in URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) ​​notation of the requested resources, information regarding access, information regarding location , the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the response given by the server (successful, error, etc.), the information regarding the user's visit including data clickstream of the URL, within and from the Site, the duration of the visit on some pages and the interaction on these pages and other parameters relating to the operating system and the user's IT environment.</p>

                            <p>These data are collected through the use of "cookies". We specifically use browser cookies for various purposes, including cookies strictly necessary for the operation of the Site and the use of services through the appropriate features, and the cookies that are used for personalization, performance/analysis and promotional activities.

                            <p>The data collected while browsing the Site will be processed to (i) manage the Site and resolve any operating problems, (ii) make sure that the content of the Site is presented in the most effective way for its devices, developing, testing and making improvements to the Site, (iii) as far as possible, to keep the Site safe and secure, (iv) to obtain anonymous statistical information on the use of the Site and to check its correct functioning, (v) identify anomalies and/or abuses in the use of the Site. The data could also be used to ascertain responsibility in case of possible computer crimes committed against the Site or third parties and may be presented to the Judicial Authority, if this makes an explicit request.</p>

                            <h2>5. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA</h2>

                            <p>In the description of the purposes in paragraph 3, we specified when it is necessary to provide Personal Data.

                            <p>This is information that is not directly associated with identified users, but which by its very nature could, through processing and association with data held by third parties, allow these users to be identified.</p>

                            <p>Finally, each Data Controller or Join Controller may need to comply with a specific legal provision to which it is subject or to defend its own right in court.</p>

                            <h4>a. Purposes related to the obligations established by laws or regulations, by decisions/requests of competent authorities or by supervisory and control bodies</h4>

                            <p>Each Data Controller or Joint Controller may process your Personal Data to comply with a legal obligation to which it is subject.</p>

                            <p>Legal basis: compliance with a legal obligation.</p>

                            <p>The provision of data for this purpose is mandatory because in the absence of data the Data Controller or the Joint Controller will not be in a position to comply with their legal obligations.</p>

                            <h4>b. Defense of rights during judicial, administrative or extra-judicial proceedings and in disputes arising in connection with the services offered</h4>

                            <p>Your Personal Data may be processed by each Data Controller or Joint Controller to defend their rights or take legal action or make claims against you or third parties, including the prevention of fraud.</p>

                            <p>Legal basis: this processing is based on the legitimate interest pursued by the Data Controller or Joint Controller to protect their rights.</p>

                            <p>The Site is managed by Marni using a platform provided for by YNAP, which manages all the purchasing activities as a data controller (Please click here to see YNAP information notice).

                            <p>In case of anonymous browsing, however, we inform you that the computer systems and software procedures used to operate the Site acquire, during their normal operation, some data whose transmission is implicit in the use of Internet communication protocols.</p>

                            <p>This is information that is not directly associated with identified users, but which by its very nature could, through processing and association with data held by third parties, allow these users to be identified.</p>

                            <p>This category of data includes the IP addresses or domain names of the computers used by users who connect to the Site, the addresses in URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) ​​notation of the requested resources, information regarding access, information regarding location , the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the response given by the server (successful, error, etc.), the information regarding the user's visit including data clickstream of the URL, within and from the Site, the duration of the visit on some pages and the interaction on these pages and other parameters relating to the operating system and the user's IT environment.</p>

                            <p>In case of anonymous browsing, however, we inform you that the computer systems and software procedures used to operate the Site acquire, during their normal operation, some data whose transmission is implicit in the use of Internet communication protocols.</p>

                            <p>This is information that is not directly associated with identified users, but which by its very nature could, through processing and association with data held by third parties, allow these users to be identified.</p>

                            <p>This category of data includes the IP addresses or domain names of the computers used by users who connect to the Site, the addresses in URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) ​​notation of the requested resources, information regarding access, information regarding location , the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the response given by the server (successful, error, etc.), the information regarding the user's visit including data clickstream of the URL, within and from the Site, the duration of the visit on some pages and the interaction on these pages and other parameters relating to the operating system and the user's IT environment.</p>

                            <h2>5. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA</h2>

                            <p>In the description of the purposes in paragraph 3, we specified when it is necessary to provide Personal Data. Where not expressly indicated as mandatory, therefore, the provision of Personal Data is optional and there will be no consequences if you do not provide them, if not the impossibility for the Data Controllers or Joint Controllers to act as described (for example, the impossibility to carry out marketing activities).</p>

                            <p>The Site is managed by Marni using a platform provided for by YNAP, which manages all the purchasing activities as a data controller (Please click here to see YNAP information notice).

In this case, while browsing the Site, you will remain anonymous, unless you decide to provide your data to communicate with one of the Data Controllers or with the Joint Controllers for one of the purposes described in paragraph 3.</p>

                            <p>In case of anonymous browsing, however, we inform you that the computer systems and software procedures used to operate the Site acquire, during their normal operation, some data whose transmission is implicit in the use of Internet communication protocols.</p>

                            <p>This is information that is not directly associated with identified users, but which by its very nature could, through processing and association with data held by third parties, allow these users to be identified.</p>

                            <p>This category of data includes the IP addresses or domain names of the computers used by users who connect to the Site, the addresses in URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) ​​notation of the requested resources, information regarding access, information regarding location , the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the response given by the server (successful, error, etc.), the information regarding the user's visit including data clickstream of the URL, within and from the Site, the duration of the visit on some pages and the interaction on these pages and other parameters relating to the operating system and the user's IT environment.</p>

The data could also be used to ascertain responsibility in case of possible computer crimes committed against the Site or third parties and may be presented to the Judicial Authority, if this makes an explicit request.</p>

                            <h2>5. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA</h2>

                            <p>Some Personal Data that we will indicate you from time to time during the registration are necessary for the completion of the purchase contract and for administrative and accounting purposes.</p>

                            <p>In the description of the purposes in paragraph 3, we specified when it is necessary to provide Personal Data. Where not expressly indicated as mandatory, therefore, the provision of Personal Data is optional and there will be no consequences if you do not provide them, if not the impossibility for the Data Controllers or Joint Controllers to act as described (for example, the impossibility to carry out marketing activities).</p>

                            <p>The Site is managed by Marni using a platform provided for by YNAP, which manages all the purchasing activities as a data controller (Please click here to see YNAP information notice). It is possible to browse the Site without having to actively communicate your Personal Data if you are not logged in. In this case, while browsing the Site, you will remain anonymous, unless you decide to provide your data to communicate with one of the Data Controllers or with the Joint Controllers for one of the purposes described in paragraph 3.</p>

                            <p>In case of anonymous browsing, however, we inform you that the computer systems and software procedures used to operate the Site acquire, during their normal operation, some data whose transmission is implicit in the use of Internet communication protocols.</p>

                            <p>This is information that is not directly associated with identified users, but which by its very nature could, through processing and association with data held by third parties, allow these users to be identified.</p>

                            <p>This category of data includes the IP addresses or domain names of the computers used by users who connect to the Site, the addresses in URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) ​​notation of the requested resources, information regarding access, information regarding location , the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the response given by the server (successful, error, etc.), the information regarding the user's visit including data clickstream of the URL, within and from the Site, the duration of the visit on some pages and the interaction on these pages and other parameters relating to the operating system and the user's IT environment.</p>

                            <p>These data are collected through the use of "cookies". We specifically use browser cookies for various purposes, including cookies strictly necessary for the operation of the Site and the use of services through the appropriate features, and the cookies that are used for personalization, performance/analysis and promotional activities.

                            <p>The data collected while browsing the Site will be processed to (i) manage the Site and resolve any operating problems, (ii) make sure that the content of the Site is presented in the most effective way for its devices, developing, testing and making improvements to the Site, (iii) as far as possible, to keep the Site safe and secure, (iv) to obtain anonymous statistical information on the use of the Site and to check its correct functioning, (v) identify anomalies and/or abuses in the use of the Site. The data could also be used to ascertain responsibility in case of possible computer crimes committed against the Site or third parties and may be presented to the Judicial Authority, if this makes an explicit request.</p>

                            <h2>5. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA</h2>

                            <p>Some Personal Data that we will indicate you from time to time during the registration are necessary for the completion of the purchase contract and for administrative and accounting purposes.</p>

                            <p>In the description of the purposes in paragraph 3, we specified when it is necessary to provide Personal Data.

                            <h2>4. WHAT PROCESSING ACTIVITIES WE CARRY OUT WHEN YOU'RE USING OUR SITE AND YOU NAVIGATE WITHOUT BEING LOGGED IN</h2>

                            <p>The Site is managed by Marni using a platform provided for by YNAP, which manages all the purchasing activities as a data controller (Please click here to see YNAP information notice). It is possible to browse the Site without having to actively communicate your Personal Data if you are not logged in. In this case, while browsing the Site, you will remain anonymous, unless you decide to provide your data to communicate with one of the Data Controllers or with the Joint Controllers for one of the purposes described in paragraph 3.</p>

                            <p>In case of anonymous browsing, however, we inform you that the computer systems and software procedures used to operate the Site acquire, during their normal operation, some data whose transmission is implicit in the use of Internet communication protocols.</p>

                            <p>This is information that is not directly associated with identified users, but which by its very nature could, through processing and association with data held by third parties, allow these users to be identified.</p>

                            <p>This category of data includes the IP addresses or domain names of the computers used by users who connect to the Site, the addresses in URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) ​​notation of the requested resources, information regarding access, information regarding location , the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the response given by the server (successful, error, etc.), the information regarding the user's visit including data clickstream of the URL, within and from the Site, the duration of the visit on some pages and the interaction on these pages and other parameters relating to the operating system and the user's IT environment.</p>

                            <p>These data are collected through the use of "cookies". We specifically use browser cookies for various purposes, including cookies strictly necessary for the operation of the Site and the use of services through the appropriate features, and the cookies that are used for personalization, performance/analysis and promotional activities.

                            <p>The data collected while browsing the Site will be processed to (i) manage the Site and resolve any operating problems, (ii) make sure that the content of the Site is presented in the most effective way for its devices, developing, testing and making improvements to the Site, (iii) as far as possible, to keep the Site safe and secure, (iv) to obtain anonymous statistical information on the use of the Site and to check its correct functioning, (v) identify anomalies and/or abuses in the use of the Site. The data could also be used to ascertain responsibility in case of possible computer crimes committed against the Site or third parties and may be presented to the Judicial Authority, if this makes an explicit request.</p>

                            <h2>5. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA</h2>

                            <p>Some Personal Data that we will indicate you from time to time during the registration are necessary for the completion of the purchase contract and for administrative and accounting purposes.</p>

                            <p>In the description of the purposes in paragraph 3, we specified when it is necessary to provide Personal Data. Where not expressly indicated as mandatory, therefore, the provision of Personal Data is optional and there will be no consequences if you do not provide them, if not the impossibility for the Data Controllers or Joint Controllers to act as described (for example, the impossibility to carry out marketing activities).</p>

                            <h2>4. WHAT PROCESSING ACTIVITIES WE CARRY OUT IF YOU'RE USING OUR SITE AND YOU NAVIGATE WITHOUT BEING LOGGED IN</h2>

                            <p>The Site is managed by Marni using a platform provided for by YNAP, which manages all the purchasing activities as a data controller (Please click here to see YNAP information notice). It is possible to browse the Site without having to actively communicate your Personal Data if you are not logged in. In this case, while browsing the Site, you will remain anonymous, unless you decide to provide your data to communicate with one of the Data Controllers or with the Joint Controllers for one of the purposes described in paragraph 3.</p>

                            <p>In case of anonymous browsing, however, we inform you that the computer systems and software procedures used to operate the Site acquire, during their normal operation, some data whose transmission is implicit in the use of Internet communication protocols.</p>

                            <p>This is information that is not directly associated with identified users, but which by its very nature could, through processing and association with data held by third parties, allow these users to be identified.</p>

                            <p>This category of data includes the IP addresses or domain names of the computers used by users who connect to the Site, the addresses in URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) ​​notation of the requested resources, information regarding access, information regarding location, the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the response given by the server (successful, error, etc.), the information regarding the user's visit including data clickstream of the URL, within and from the Site, the duration of the visit on some pages and the interaction on these pages and other parameters relating to the operating system and the user's IT environment.</p>

                            <p>These data are collected through the use of "cookies". We specifically use browser cookies for various purposes, including cookies strictly necessary for the operation of the Site and the use of services through the appropriate features, and the cookies that are used for personalization, performance/analysis and promotional activities. Our Cookie Policy [https://www.marni.com/ytos/Plugins/AreaLocalizer/Redirectarea?area=Help&#38;controllerName=LegalArea&#38;actionName=CookiePolicy] contains more information regarding the use of cookies on the Site, as well as the options for accepting or rejecting them.</p>

                            <p>The data collected while browsing the Site will be processed to (i) manage the Site and resolve any operating problems, (ii) make sure that the content of the Site is presented in the most effective way for its devices, developing, testing and making improvements to the Site, (iii) as far as possible, to keep the Site safe and secure, (iv) to obtain anonymous statistical information on the use of the Site and to check its correct functioning, (v) identify anomalies and/or abuses in the use of the Site. The data could also be used to ascertain responsibility in case of possible computer crimes committed against the Site or third parties and may be presented to the Judicial Authority, if this makes an explicit request.</p>

                            <h2>5. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA</h2>

                            <p>Some Personal Data that we will indicate you from time to time during the registration are necessary for the completion of the purchase contract and for administrative and accounting purposes, as well as for compliance with legal obligations and for legitimate interests pursued by Data Controllers as detailed in paragraph 3.</p>

                            <p>In the description of the purposes in paragraph 3, we specified when it is necessary to provide Personal Data. Where not expressly indicated as mandatory, therefore, the provision of Personal Data is optional and there will be no consequences if you do not provide them, if not the impossibility for the Data Controllers or Joint Controllers to act as described (for example, the impossibility to carry out marketing activities).</p>

                            <p>The Site is managed by Marni using a platform provided for by YNAP, which manages all the purchasing activities as a data controller (Please click here to see YNAP information notice).

In this case, while browsing the Site, you will remain anonymous, unless you decide to provide your data to communicate with one of the Data Controllers or with the Joint Controllers for one of the purposes described in paragraph 3.</p>

                            <p>In case of anonymous browsing, however, we inform you that the computer systems and software procedures used to operate the Site acquire, during their normal operation, some data whose transmission is implicit in the use of Internet communication protocols.</p>

                            <p>This is information that is not directly associated with identified users, but which by its very nature could, through processing and association with data held by third parties, allow these users to be identified.</p>

                            <p>This category of data includes the IP addresses or domain names of the computers used by users who connect to the Site, the addresses in URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) ​​notation of the requested resources, information regarding access, information regarding location , the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the response given by the server (successful, error, etc.), the information regarding the user's visit including data clickstream of the URL, within and from the Site, the duration of the visit on some pages and the interaction on these pages and other parameters relating to the operating system and the user's IT environment.</p>

We specifically use browser cookies for various purposes, including cookies strictly necessary for the operation of the Site and the use of services through the appropriate features, and the cookies that are used for personalization, performance/analysis and promotional activities.

The data could also be used to ascertain responsibility in case of possible computer crimes committed against the Site or third parties and may be presented to the Judicial Authority, if this makes an explicit request.</p>

                            <h2>5. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA</h2>

                            <p>Some Personal Data that we will indicate you from time to time during the registration are necessary for the completion of the purchase contract and for administrative and accounting purposes.</p>

                            <h2>4. WHAT PROCESSING ACTIVITIES WE CARRY OUT WHEN YOU'RE USING OUR SITE AND YOU NAVIGATE WITHOUT BEING LOGGED IN</h2>

                            <p>The Site is managed by Marni using a platform provided for by YNAP, which manages all the purchasing activities as a data controller (Please click here to see YNAP information notice). It is possible to browse the Site without having to actively communicate your Personal Data if you are not logged in. In this case, while browsing the Site, you will remain anonymous, unless you decide to provide your data to communicate with one of the Data Controllers or with the Joint Controllers for one of the purposes described in paragraph 3.</p>

                            <p>In case of anonymous browsing, however, we inform you that the computer systems and software procedures used to operate the Site acquire, during their normal operation, some data whose transmission is implicit in the use of Internet communication protocols.</p>

                            <p>This is information that is not directly associated with identified users, but which by its very nature could, through processing and association with data held by third parties, allow these users to be identified.</p>

                            <p>This category of data includes the IP addresses or domain names of the computers used by users who connect to the Site, the addresses in URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) ​​notation of the requested resources, information regarding access, information regarding location , the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the response given by the server (successful, error, etc.), the information regarding the user's visit including data clickstream of the URL, within and from the Site, the duration of the visit on some pages and the interaction on these pages and other parameters relating to the operating system and the user's IT environment.</p>

                            <p>These data are collected through the use of "cookies". We specifically use browser cookies for various purposes, including cookies strictly necessary for the operation of the Site and the use of services through the appropriate features, and the cookies that are used for personalization, performance/analysis and promotional activities. Our Cookie Policy [https://www.marni.com/ytos/Plugins/AreaLocalizer/Redirectarea?area=Help&#38;controllerName=LegalArea&#38;actionName=CookiePolicy] contains more information regarding the use of cookies on the Site, as well as the options for accepting or rejecting them.</p>

                            <p>The data collected while browsing the Site will be processed to (i) manage the Site and resolve any operating problems, (ii) make sure that the content of the Site is presented in the most effective way for its devices, developing, testing and making improvements to the Site, (iii) as far as possible, to keep the Site safe and secure, (iv) to obtain anonymous statistical information on the use of the Site and to check its correct functioning, (v) identify anomalies and/or abuses in the use of the Site. The data could also be used to ascertain responsibility in case of possible computer crimes committed against the Site or third parties and may be presented to the Judicial Authority, if this makes an explicit request.</p>

                            <h2>5. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA</h2>

                            <p>Some Personal Data that we will indicate you from time to time during the registration are necessary for the completion of the purchase contract and for administrative and accounting purposes.</p>

                            <p>In the description of the purposes in paragraph 3, we specified when it is necessary to provide Personal Data.

En este caso, en el momento en que retire su consentimiento, eliminaremos sus datos.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>En cualquier caso, por razones técnicas, la terminación del tratamiento y la consiguiente cancelación o anonimización irreversible de los relativos Datos Personales será definitiva en un plazo de treinta días a partir de los plazos indicados anteriormente.</p>

                            <p>En particular, en lo que respecta a la protección judicial de nuestros derechos o en caso de que se produzcan solicitudes por parte de la autoridad, los datos tratados se conservarán durante el tiempo necesario para procesar la solicitud o proteger el derecho.</p>

The data could also be used to ascertain responsibility in case of possible computer crimes committed against the Site or third parties and may be presented to the Judicial Authority, if this makes an explicit request.</p>

                            <h2>5. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA</h2>

                            <p>Some Personal Data that we will indicate you from time to time during the registration or purchase process are necessary for the completion of the purchase contract and for administrative and accounting purposes.</p>

                            <p>In the description of the purposes in paragraph 3, we specified when it is necessary to provide Personal Data. Where not expressly indicated as mandatory, therefore, the provision of Personal Data is optional and there will be no consequences if you do not provide them, unless it is impossible for the Data Controllers or Joint Controllers to act as described (for example, the impossibility to carry out marketing activities).</p>

                            <h2> 6. HOW AND HOW LONG WE WILL PROCESS PERSONAL DATA</h2>

                            <p>The Personal Data provided to and/or collected by the Data Controllers or the Joint Controllers are processed and stored with automated tools and, in some cases, may be processed and stored on a paper backing. In particular, the Personal Data processed for purposes of marketing and of marketing in line with your preferences will be entered and stored in the CRM systems that allow the processing of Personal Data for these purposes.</p>

                            <p>The Personal Data will be stored for the time necessary to achieve the purposes for which they were collected. In particular, the following rules will apply:</p>

                            </ul>

If you still wish to learn more about our compliance with this requirement, please contact us at the address listed in paragraph 1.</p>

                            <p>As of January 1, 2020, you may be entitled to the below rights:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>the right to know. </strong>You may request information about the categories and specific pieces of Personal Data we have collected about you over the last 12 months, as well as the categories of sources from which such information is collected, the purpose for collecting such information, and the sale or disclosure for business purposes of your Personal Data to third parties, and the categories of third parties with whom this information was shared.

                            <h2>12. HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS</h2>

                            <p> The "Do Not Track" ("DNT") privacy preference is an option that may be made in some web browsers allowing you to opt-out of tracking by websites and online services. At this time, global standard DNT technology is not yet finalized and not all browsers support DNT. We therefore do not recognize DNT signals and do not respond to them.</p>

                            <h2>13. THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISING</h2>

                            <p>We may use advertisers, third-party ad platform, tracking technologies and other advertising companies to serve advertisements on the Site and to improve the performance of our advertising across the Internet.

                            <p>By using the Site, you and we agree that, if there is any controversy, claim, action, or dispute arising out of or related to your use of the Site, or the breach, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of this Privacy Statement or any part of it ("Dispute"), both parties shall first try in good faith to settle such Dispute by providing written notice to the other party describing the facts and circumstances of the Dispute and allowing the receiving party 30 days in which to respond to or settle the Dispute.</p>
